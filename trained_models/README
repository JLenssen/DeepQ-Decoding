This folder contains all trained models and final results.

In particular, for both bitflip and depolarising noise, the relevant folder contains:

    1) A fixed_config.p file, containing the fixed hyper-parameters used for all simulations.
    2) A subfolder for each error rate at which agents were trained

Each error-rate subfolder then contains:
