    "##### 3a) Evaluating a Trained Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a trained decoder we would of course like to benchmark the decoder to evaluate how well it performs. This procedure is very similar to training the decoder, in that we run multiple decoding episodes in which the agent interacts with the environment until it \"dies\" - however in this context we would like the agent to use only a greedy policy for action selection, i.e. to never make random moves, and we do not need to update the agents parameters in time. As we will see benchmarking an agent is made easy by use of the DQNAgent class \"test\" method."
